        <h2 id="goal">Goals</h2>
        <p> The Hardware-Based Web Security Working Group will develop
          recommendation-track documents that define a standard to provide
          secure services for high security Web applications. </p>
        <p> There are a number of use cases that this standard will enable,
          including but not limited to the ability to encrypt and to decrypt
          data using hardware based encryption modules, the ability to
          manage credential information for hardware based security modules,
          and the ability to access specific security sensitive services
          offered by hardware tokens. Such security sensitive services may
          include: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Payments – transaction authorization</li>
          <li>Identity verification</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group’s scope is Hardware-Based Web Security standard services, enabling Web pages the use of secure services enabled by hardware modules (TEE, secure elements, and other secure enablers). The group may produce non-Recommendation track documents within this scope. Recommendations are limited to the Restricted Scope Items described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because web app using services providing some security sensitive functions may be sensitive to the users, this WG will take special care to make sure that the deliverables do not compromise user privacy and potential anonymity. As such, deliverables will take special care of fingerprinting and tracking threats. In addition, some mechanisms will be associated to make sure security functions will be used under the user control. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Restricted Scope for Recommendation Track Deliverables</h3>
        
        <p>
          The Working Group Scope for Recommendation Track Deliverables will be restricted during this Charter period to the following Restricted Scope Items. Recommendation deliverables may only be added if they clearly fall within a Restricted Scope Item here. Restricted Scope Items must be carefully described so the types of technologies needed for implementation are clear. The group must recharter to add new Restricted Scope Items.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Discovery &amp; Attestation:</strong> Means of requesting access to a secure hardware component that satisfies some criteria, with user approval. Means of indicating to the requesting Web page who vouches for the Secure Hardware Component and what level of security is provided (e.g. digitally signed challenge; indication if Secure Hardware Component is isolated from Operating System, or just from Web Browser/UA).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto Key Discovery:</strong> Discovery of pre-provisioned, named, origin specific cryptographic keys for use with the Web Crypto API or an API provided by this WG.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto Key Management:</strong> Importing, creating, deleting keys for a particular origin. Working Group would define trust/permission model for use of cryptographic functions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto API:</strong> Maintenance or extension of the Web Crypto API after the first version. May also define other Crypto API specifically for Secure Hardware.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Storage API:</strong> Origin specific storage and retrieval of data. This would prevent access by other applications on the device or even from the hardware depending on the level of security provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware IO:</strong> Means to ask for and obtain user input that is protected against compromised operating system or UA/Browser depending on the level provided. This could return a digitally signed (by the hardware component) response from the user. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Worker:</strong> API to execute JavaScript or WebAssembly code in a Secure Hardware Component (allowing, but not necessarily requiring both). Like a Web Worker this would communicate to the calling Web page code using a message channel provided by the User Agent/Browser. A Secure Worker would not necessarily have the same APIs available as a Web Worker and the spec would define the type of data that may be passed. APIs used by Service Workers would be included by reference to specifications created under other Restricted Scope Items or other external sources. This Restricted Scope Item covers what is needed to create, execute and communicate with Secure Workers. Sharing Secure Workers could be restricted to be used from the context that created them, or could also be used from other contexts (tabs, iframes) from the same origin, or to other origins it specifies that it permits (like CORS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binding mechanism:</strong> Means to bind the result of a secure communication to a secure hardware to a certain context, origin or transaction and restrict the validity of bearer tokens and other secure vouchers accordingly. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identity semantics:</strong> Means to extract identity information from a secure hardware under control of the user, including the choice or creation of the subsequent data format made available via the API. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Web payments access: Cooperate with the Web payments WG to allow access to payment related hardware via the hardware APIs developed within the HASEC Group. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Web Services Interfaces</h3>
        
        <p>
          Services defined in this Working Group (under other Restricted Scope Items) could also be exposed through Web Services to a nearby device or to the cloud. This could be accessed through the same APIs as those defined in other Restricted Scope Items, but where the implementation is remote rather than installed locally and the User Agent proxies the requests. In addition, where appropriate, each of the APIs defined for the other Restricted Scope Items could have an explicit Web Service version (e.g. restful APIs for services and Web Sockets as the message channel). That would allow the same services to be used outside the Web Browser context and also to be used in the Internet of Things.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
        
        <p>
          The Working Group does not define how hardware security is accomplished. It defines how to ask hardware security for basic services where a secure hardware environment is available. The group will also not define crypto algorithms.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="success">Success Criteria</h3>
        <p> If the Working Group successfully identifies at least one
          candidate protocol or API in this manner, it may suggest a charter
          for further work in this area.</p>
        <p>The Group is successful if the following criteria are met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participation via mailing list subscription and postings from
            people representing various stakeholder communities, including
            banks, payment industry, various legal and regulatory bodies
            with mandates that are related to authentication, authorization
            and secure transmission, hardware and software developers,
            mobile operator companies, browser vendors and developers of
            secure applications</li>
          <li>Discussion of requirements and use cases and elaboration of a
            NOTE on use cases and requirements for hardware based security
            on the Web</li>
          <li>Successfully engage and coordinate with Groups working on Web
            Applications and their components as well as with other Security
            Groups within W3C and beyond</li>
          <li>Engage a dialog with the governmental identity systems that
            require a higher level of security</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="deliverables">
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>

        <p>
          All Recommendations must have associated Use Cases describing the scenarios that the deliverable is intended to enable. These will be used to guide specification development. Use Cases are not normative interoperability specifications. They are informative, so do not need to be in a REC track document.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Recommendations Deliverables List</h3>
        
        <p>
          Deliverables approved by the Working Group will be listed the group’s homepage or gitHub repo linked from the homepage. Those deliverables will be listed under the Restricted Scope Item they conform to. Specific Deliverables, identifying their corresponding Restricted Scope Item, may also be listed in this Charter by rechartering. There are no specific deliverables identified at this time.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Other Deliverables (not W3C Recommendations)</h3>
        
        <p>
          The group may also develop other deliverables that are not Recommendations. These are not limited by the Restricted Scope.

      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
      <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public
        mailing list at <a href="mailto:public-hasec-wg@w3.org">public-hasec-wg@w3.org</a>
        (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-hasec-wg/">archive</a>).
See
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/">W3C mailing list and archive usage
          guidelines</a>. There is also a member-only list to be used for
        administrative or member-confidential purposes at <a href="mailto:member-hasec-wg@w3.org">member-hasec-wg@w3.org</a>
        (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-hasec-wg/">archive</a>).</p>
      <p>Information about the group (documents under review, face-to-face
        meetings, etc.) is available from the <a href="/2015/hasec/">Web
          Hardware Security Working Group home page</a>. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>The group will aim to proceed by consensus. </p>
      <p>Where there is consensus among the representatives of W3C members
        in the group, it will be forwarded as a consensus position. Where
        the group does not reach agreement, the different positions (whether
        held by W3C members or other members of the group) will be
        considered together. </p>
      <p>All technical resolutions made by a meeting of the group are
        provisional until two weeks after being published to the mailing
        list. An objection made on the mailing list within two weeks of
        publishing a decision has the same standing as if it were made at
        the meeting. </p>

    <div class="patent">
      <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Disclosures </h2>
      <p>The Hardware Security Working Group provides an opportunity to
        share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C
        reminds Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply
        with patent disclosure obligations as set out in <a shape="rect" href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
          6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
        produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
        participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
        Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>
