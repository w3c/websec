        <h2 id="goal">Goals</h2>
        <p> The Hardware-Based Web Security Working Group will develop
          recommendation-track documents that define a standard to provide
          secure services for high security Web applications. </p>
        <p> There are a number of use cases that this standard will enable,
          including but not limited to the ability to encrypt and to decrypt
          data using hardware based encryption modules, the ability to
          manage credential information for hardware based security modules,
          and the ability to access specific security sensitive services
          offered by hardware tokens. Such security sensitive services may
          include: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Payments – transaction authorization</li>
          <li>Identity verification</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group’s scope is Hardware-Based Web Security
          standard services, enabling Web pages the use of secure
          services enabled by security modules (TEE, secure elements,
          and other secure enablers with a demonstrated robustness to
          physical or software attacks). The group may produce
          non-Recommendation track documents within this scope.
          Recommendations are limited to the Restricted Scope Items
          described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications like those to be produced by this group could
          impact user privacy and potential anonymity. Special care will
          be taken to avoid introducing fingerprinting and tracking
          threats in deliverables from this group. One mechanism to
          alleviate these potential problems is to place permission to
          use some functions under the user's control in a way in which
          the user understands the privacy implications. The group will
          seek review from the Privacy Interest Group.
       </p>

        <h3>Restricted Scope for Recommendation Track Deliverables</h3>

        <p>
          The Working Group Scope for Recommendation Track Deliverables
          will be restricted during this Charter period to the following
          Restricted Scope Items. Recommendation deliverables may only
          be added if they clearly fall within a Restricted Scope Item
          here. Restricted Scope Items must be carefully described so
          the types of technologies needed for implementation are clear.
          The group must recharter to add new Restricted Scope Items.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Discovery &amp;
              Attestation:</strong> Means of requesting access to a
            service that satisfies some criteria, with user approval.
            Means of indicating to the requesting Web page what party
            vouches that the service satisfies the criteria (e.g.
            digitally signed challenge; indication if Secure Hardware
            Component is isolated from Operating System, or just from
            Web Browser/UA). The other restricted scope items could be
            satisfied through references to some existing spec along
            with a way to request and verify the level of security of
            the implementation.  For example, a secure worker restricted
            scope item (see below) could be satified by something like
            1) reference to the Web Worker spec; 2) a means of
            requesting that a Worker be executed in an environment that
            cannot be tampered with even by the operating sytem and the
            response is signed by a trusted party verifying the
            implementation is available (with a nonce to prevent replay)
            and a token to use to request starting a worker in that
            environment; 3) extension to Web Workers creation to include
            passing the token; 4) API for the running Worker to ask
            environment to sign a challenge for attestation of the
            environment it is running in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto Key Discovery:</strong>
            Discovery of pre-provisioned, named, origin specific
            cryptographic keys for use with the Web Crypto API or an API
            provided by this WG.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto Key Management:</strong>
            Importing, creating, deleting keys for a particular origin.
            Working Group would define trust/permission model for use of
            cryptographic functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Crypto API:</strong> Maintenance or
            extension of the Web Crypto API after the first version. May
            also define other Crypto API specifically for Secure
            Hardware.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware Storage API:</strong> Origin specific 
            storage and retrieval of data. This would prevent access by other 
            applications on the device or even from the hardware depending 
            on the level of security provided. This API could be restricted 
            to be used only by a Secure Worker. This API must use or enhance 
            (an) existing Web Platform storage API(s), not create a new 
            storage mechanism. Additional APIs defined by the group could 
            provide a way for the Secure Worker to determine whether stored 
            data was already encrypted by the implementation so that the 
            Secure Worker could decide whether to encrypt stored data itself. 
            The Working Group could decide to make that API also available 
            for querying in Web pages about normal storage implementations 
            outside Secure Workers (to determine if they are encrypted 
            sufficiently).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Hardware IO:</strong> Means to ask for and
            obtain user input that is protected against compromised
            operating system or UA/Browser depending on the level
            provided. This could return a digitally signed (by the
            hardware component) response from the user. This API is
            intended to be used only by a Secure Worker, as an optional
            API, and could be a very small subset of HTML for form
            input.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Worker:</strong> API to execute JavaScript or
            WebAssembly code in a Secure Hardware Component (allowing,
            but not necessarily requiring both scripting languages).
            Like a Web Worker this would communicate to the calling Web
            page code using a message channel provided by the User
            Agent/Browser. A Secure Worker would not necessarily have
            the same APIs available as a Web Worker and the spec would
            define the type of data that may be passed. APIs used by
            Secure Workers would be included by reference to
            specifications created under other Restricted Scope Items or
            other external sources. This Restricted Scope Item covers
            what is needed to create, execute and communicate with
            Secure Workers. Sharing Secure Workers could be restricted
            to be used from the context that created them, or could also
            be used from other contexts (tabs, iframes) from the same
            origin, or to other origins it specifies that it permits
            (like CORS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binding mechanism:</strong> Means to bind the result
            of a secure communication to a secure hardware to a certain
            context, origin or transaction and restrict the validity of
            bearer tokens and other secure vouchers accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identity semantics:</strong> Means to extract
            identity information from a secure hardware under control of
            the user, including the choice or creation of the subsequent
            data format made available via the API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hardware tokens:</strong> Specify a common mechanism
            for accessing hardware tokens.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web Services Interfaces</h3>

        <p>
          Services defined in this Working Group (under the Restricted Scope Items) 
          could also be exposed, in Recommendation Track Deliverables, through Web 
          Services to a nearby device or to the cloud. The APIs would additionally 
          be described in terms of message content (e.g using JSON) that could be 
          delivered by means like RESTful Web Services, Web Sockets, or some other 
          message delivery mechanism. That would allow the same security services 
          to be used outside the Web Browser context, in the Internet of Things 
          for example, or as services from the cloud.
        </p>

        <h3>Out of Scope</h3>

        <p>
          The Working Group does not define how hardware security is
          accomplished. It defines how to ask hardware security for
          basic services where a secure hardware environment is
          available. The group will also not define crypto algorithms.
        </p>

        <h3 id="success">Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>The Group is successful if the following criteria are met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Participation via mailing list subscription and postings from
            people representing various stakeholder communities, including
            banks, payment industry, various legal and regulatory bodies
            with mandates that are related to authentication, authorization
            and secure transmission, hardware and software developers,
            mobile operator companies, browser vendors and developers of
            secure applications
          </li>
          <li>
            Discussion of requirements and use cases and publishing a
            Working Group NOTE on use cases and requirements for
            hardware based security on the Web. The NOTE will determine
            the priority of the restricted items in section 2.1 to be
            addressed
          </li>
          <li>Successfully engage and coordinate with Groups working on Web
            Applications and their components as well as with other Security
            Groups within W3C and beyond
          </li>
          <li>Engage a dialog with the governmental identity systems that
            require a higher level of security
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="deliverables">
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>

        <p>
          Deliverables will be identified from among those listed in 2.1
          and chosen by Working Group consensus. All Recommendations
          must have associated use cases describing the scenarios that
          the deliverable is intended to enable. These will be used to
          guide specification development. use cases are not normative
          interoperability specifications. They are informative, so do
          not need to be in a REC track document.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group may produce Recommendation-Track deliverables within
          the scope of the Restricted Scope Items of this Charter.  These
          deliverables, when chosen by the Working Group, will be listed
          on the group’s homepage or the GitHub repo linked from the homepage,
          under the Restricted Scope Item in which they fit.  When rechartering,
          specific Recommendation-Track deliverables could also be listed,
          but none are listed in this Charter.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Deliverables (not W3C Recommendations)</h3>

        <p>
          The group may also develop other deliverables that are not
          Recommendations. These are not limited by the Restricted
          Scope.  As described above, these must be within the Working
          Group Scope. This could include use cases or best practices
          for using the APIs being developed or to explore possible
          future work in developing future versions of this Charter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group will liaise with the Web Payments Working
          Group on web payments access. The expected non normative
          deliverables with Web Payments WG are use case and an
          architecture document, focusing on payment integration in the
          web payment API designed when payment means relies on
          hardware.
