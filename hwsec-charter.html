        <h2 id="goal">Goals</h2>
        <p> The Hardware-Based Web Security Working Group will develop
          recommendation-track documents that define a standard to provide
          secure services for high security Web applications. </p>
        <p> There are a number of use cases that this standard will enable,
          including but not limited to the ability to encrypt and to decrypt
          data using hardware based encryption modules, the ability to
          manage credential information for hardware based security modules,
          and the ability to access specific security sensitive services
          offered by hardware tokens. Such security sensitive services may
          include: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Payments – transaction authorization</li>
          <li>Identity verification</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p> The Working Group will collect relevant use cases the open web
          platform should address, identify technical gaps and determine use
          cases that the standard needs to support. The Working Group will
          use these to derive requirements and a possible architecture for
          interaction between user agent and hardware based modules. One or
          several recommendations will be developed, based on those
          requirements. </p>
        <p>Specification features shall be derived from requirements driven
          by concrete use-cases. Success will be determined by the
          implementation of features as defined by the recommendations.
          Features that are not implemented due to time constraints can be
          put in a non-normative "roadmap" document for future work. </p>
        <p> Example features in scope for use-cases include: attesting the
          presence of hardware module, enabling secure environment execution
          for Javascript, using specific services enabled in hardware
          module, hardware-based key usage, and cryptographic primitives.</p>
        <p>The HaSec Working Group will produce specifications that target a
          wide deployment. To do so, the Group should adopt, refine and when
          needed, extend, existing practices and community-driven draft
          specifications. Specifications should integrate well with Web
          Applications, thus be developed in concert with Web Application
          developers and the Web Application Security and HTML Working
          Groups.</p>
        <h3 id="success">Success Criteria</h3>
        <p> If the Working Group successfully identifies at least one
          candidate protocol or API in this manner, it may suggest a charter
          for further work in this area.</p>
        <p>The Group is successful if the following criteria are met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participation via mailing list subscription and postings from
            people representing various stakeholder communities, including
            banks, payment industry, various legal and regulatory bodies
            with mandates that are related to authentication, authorization
            and secure transmission, hardware and software developers,
            mobile operator companies, browser vendors and developers of
            secure applications</li>
          <li>Discussion of requirements and use cases and elaboration of a
            NOTE on use cases and requirements for hardware based security
            on the Web</li>
          <li>Successfully engage and coordinate with Groups working on Web
            Applications and their components as well as with other Security
            Groups within W3C and beyond</li>
          <li>Engage a dialog with the governmental identity systems that
            require a higher level of security</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="deliverables">
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>
        <p>The working group will deliver at least the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use-Case Document</strong>: This use-case document will define a finite
            set of use-cases for secure execution environments and hardware 
            token, accessed by Web applications, and recommend/discuss how 
            user agent and hardware module should interact, taking into 
            account the SOP and access control aspects.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Hardware-Based Web Security Standard Services:</strong> 
          Commonly-used services such as cryptographic services, payment and 
          legal identity based on hardware module should be made available 
          to Web application developers via a set of standards to facilitate 
          the operations detailed in the use case document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A specification should make commonly-used cryptographic primitives using 
          hardware-based security module available to Web application developers 
          to facilitate the operations detailed in the use case document. 
          This work should leverage on works already been discussed in the W3C 
          Web Cryptography WG, WebApps WG, HTML WG, and IETF Web Security WG. 
          The Specification on Hardware-Based Web Security Standard Services 
          should take advantage of existing platform and operating-system 
          cryptography libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifications must contain a section detailing any known security 
          implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users. The Hardware-Based 
          Web Security WG will actively seek an open security review.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
        <p>The Working group will deliver at least the following
          non-normative documents:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Test suite for the Hardware-Based Web Security specification;
          </li>
          <li>Primer or Best Practice documents to support web developers
            when designing applications dealing with the Hardware-Based Web
            Security specification</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="dependencies">

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>Participation is open to W3C Members and invited experts. </p>
      <p>In order to make rapid progress, the group MAY form several Task
        Forces (TFs), each working on a separate topic. Group members are
        free to join any number of TFs. </p>
      <p>Participants are reminded of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">
          Good Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
      <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public
        mailing list at <a href="mailto:public-hasec-wg@w3.org">public-webpayments-ig@w3.org</a>
        (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-hasec-wg/">archive</a>).
See
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/">W3C mailing list and archive usage
          guidelines</a>. There is also a member-only list to be used for
        administrative or member-confidential purposes at <a href="mailto:member-hasec-wg@w3.org">member-hasec-wg@w3.org</a>
        (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-hasec-wg/">archive</a>).</p>
      <p>Information about the group (documents under review, face-to-face
        meetings, etc.) is available from the <a href="/2015/hasec/">Web
          Hardware Security Working Group home page</a>. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>The group will aim to proceed by consensus. </p>
      <p>Where there is consensus among the representatives of W3C members
        in the group, it will be forwarded as a consensus position. Where
        the group does not reach agreement, the different positions (whether
        held by W3C members or other members of the group) will be
        considered together. </p>
      <p>All technical resolutions made by a meeting of the group are
        provisional until two weeks after being published to the mailing
        list. An objection made on the mailing list within two weeks of
        publishing a decision has the same standing as if it were made at
        the meeting. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="patent">
      <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Disclosures </h2>
      <p>The Hardware Security Working Group provides an opportunity to
        share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C
        reminds Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply
        with patent disclosure obligations as set out in <a shape="rect" href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
          6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
        produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
        participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
        Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>
      <p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
        please see the <a shape="rect" href="/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent
          Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
